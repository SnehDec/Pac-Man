# Pac-Man
A modified version of the arcade game Pac-Man

# The Game
In this version of the Pac-Man game, we start with four ghosts in the first level and after every two levels, an additional ghost is added to the game. The maximum number of ghosts is 8. 
The code files contain detailed comments on the code itself.

I modified Conor Bailey's maze generation file to generate the maze for this game. I also modified William Fiset's breadth-first search algorithm from his YouTube tutorial.
